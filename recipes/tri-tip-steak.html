<h1>The Best Beef Tri-Tip</h1>
<img src="../images/tri-tip-steak.webp">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This tri-tip recipe came about after I received a food wish for roast beef, which can be done with many different cuts. I ended up deciding on beef tri-tip since it's affordable, flavorful, great for parties, and, using this low-temp roasting technique, nearly fool-proof. No marinating, no searing, no nothing; just rub on some salt and spices and pop it into the oven until it reaches the doneness you want. Plate it up with a Romano bean salad or enjoy as a roast beef sandwich!
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves</li>
<li>1 (2 1/2 pound) beef tri-tip roast</li>
<li>½ cup beef broth (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).</li>

<li>Mix salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, dried rosemary, and fresh rosemary together in a small bowl.</li>

<li>Place tri-tip in a baking pan. Season generously with the spice rub until both sides are completely covered.</li>

<li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare, or until desired doneness, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Flip meat over halfway.</li>

<li>Cover pan with aluminum foil and let meat rest for 20 minutes. Remove tri-tip to a cutting board and cut into 2 pieces along where the grain changes direction. Slice meat across the grain and transfer to serving plates.</li>

<li>Mix beef broth in with the pan drippings and drizzle over the slices.</li>
</ol>
